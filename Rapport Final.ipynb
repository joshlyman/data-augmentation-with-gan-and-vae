    "Working with imbalanced classes represents a challenge that most machine learning practitioners will face. When combined with a limited number of training instances, imbalanced classes can result in poorly trained models. Having few instances from which to learn, algorithms may have a limited ability to generalize, and therefore suffer from poor performance on unseen data."

    "Various strategies have been suggested to negate the effects of class imbalance [$^{ref}$](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417416307175?via%3Dihub). A strategy is to cluster minority instances using a semi-unsupervised hierarchical clustering approach to determine the size to oversample each sub-cluster using its classification complexity and cross validation. Then, the minority instances are oversampled depending on their Euclidean distance to the majority class. [$^{ref}$](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417415007356) <font color='red'>_this excerpt was copy pasted_</font>. Minority instances can also be weighted according to their distance to the majority class [$^{ref}$](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0180830). "

    "Counteracting the effects of class imbalance in image recognition tasks add another layer of difficulty. Yet, some methods have been suggested. By matching pairs of images (taking the mean of every pixel), accuracy was improved on the CIFAR-10, compared to the generic dataset [$^{ref}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02929). In a similar fashion, state-of-the-art results on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet have been achieved using translation, rotation, or shearing of different magnitudes [$^{ref}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09501). Another method to provide more training samples was to cut the \"main\" component of the image, and paste it on different backgrounds [$^{ref}$](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2017/html/Dwibedi_Cut_Paste_and_ICCV_2017_paper.html)."
