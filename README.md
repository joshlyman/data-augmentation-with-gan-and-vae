# data-augmentation-with-gan-and-vae
We're using the UTK Faces dataset to determine if we can train a ConvNet better with generated samples. 

1. [First we trained a VAE](https://github.com/nicolas-gervais/data-augmentation-with-gan-and-vae/blob/master/Variational%20Auto%20Encoder%20on%20Human%20Faces.ipynb) to generate human faces
2. [Then we trained a ConvNet with Pytorch](https://github.com/nicolas-gervais/data-augmentation-with-gan-and-vae/blob/master/Pytorch%20ConvNet%20Distinguishing%20Men%20and%20Women.ipynb) but it didn't work.
3. So we tried with Keras to see what was the problem.
